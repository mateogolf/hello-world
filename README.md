# hello-world
This is the guide related project.  I have always been interested in coding, taking a few classes from high school to college.
In the last job, I created a few access database projects to help manage inventory and project management within the program.
I was mostly doing admin-type work, but the most fun I had on the job was when I was coding and finding ways to automate the
repetitive actions that I would have to do.  This included automatically filling a pdf with input from the database using a form.
